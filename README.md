# House Price Predictor

## Problem Description
This project is based on the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques". The objective is to predict the sales price for each house. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, the challenge is to determine the final price of each home.

## Dataset
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It offers an expanded and modernized alternative to the frequently-cited Boston Housing dataset.

Note: Due to Kaggle's competition rules, the data is not included in this repository. You can acquire the dataset directly from the competition's data page. Once downloaded, place the data files (train.csv, test.csv, etc.) in the data/ directory of this repository.

## Approach
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing necessary transformations.
- Feature Engineering: Generating new features and transforming existing ones to better represent the underlying patterns in the data.
- Modeling: Implementing advanced regression techniques like random forests to predict house prices.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the required packages by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Place your data in the `data/` directory.
4. Navigate to the src/ directory and run the main script.
