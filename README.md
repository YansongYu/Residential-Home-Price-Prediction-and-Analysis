# Residential-Home-Price-Prediction-and-Analysis

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting residential home prices based on various property attributes. The dataset, which comprises properties from Ames, Iowa, provides a comprehensive set of features describing different aspects of residential homes, making it an ideal candidate for in-depth analysis and modeling.

# Key Highlights:

- Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying patterns and correlations within the data.
- Advanced feature engineering and preprocessing, including handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- Utilized machine learning techniques like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressors to train and evaluate prediction models.
- Fine-tuned models to achieve higher accuracy, aiding in more precise home price predictions.
  
# Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to predict the sale price of residential homes, assisting real estate businesses, and potential homeowners in making informed decisions.
